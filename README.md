# My-Work-for-Medical-Condition-Multi-Classification-Project
This repository contains the contributions I made for one of my group projects: Evaluation of Multi-Class Classification Models on a Medical Dataset


## File Descriptions
- project_draft.ipynb: Primarily the file where I conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to get an overview of the data and perform data preprocessing; also served as a first draft for my LightGBM model.
- project_testing.ipynb: The 2nd draft for my LightGBM model along with a plot showcasing feature importance.
- main.ipynb: The primary work file where after finalizing preprocessing steps with my group, I was able to test my finalized LightGBM and CatBoost models, as well as my teammates XGBoost and Random Forest models.
- ensemble.ipynb: Displays the steps and results of the stacking ensemble that combined select models to achieve our best classification accuracy

Note: If you don't want to download the main notebook file (Too big to be displayed on the repository) to view my model results, then just click the link below (Takes a while to load)

## Credits
- Credits to teammate Nam Nguyen for the preprocessing.py, XGB.py files
   - I did conduct data preprocessing myself but our group decided to use my teammate's for uniformity and concision
   - Teammate helped build the XGBoost model
- Credits to teammate Cara Mann for the RandomForest.py file
   - Teammate helped build the Random Forest model
